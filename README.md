# Reflex_o_type

This is an [SFLM](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) based GUI application.
Although it is an fully functioning app, some of the functionality is still incomplete as we made it in limited time frame for our project.
So you can also contribute to complete this.

# ABSTRACT
This project aims to find typing speed of users and provide them a gaming interface to 
amuse themselves with the software. This typing software has two modes: classic mode 
and rapid mode. In classic mode, users have to type sentence whereas in rapid mode, 
they have to type random word displayed in screen and this mode has got time limit. 
Through rapid mode, users will be able to analyze themselves with their own typing 
abilities and this mode is lot more amusing than classic mode.



There is separate user info section in which users will get the information about the 
time they have spent typing and their average typing speed and accuracy with the words.
